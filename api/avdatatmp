In turn, our work reduces the number of drug-related hospitalizations and arrests.\r\n \r\nThis year, millions of people will use psychedelics outside of supervised medical contexts, many of them for the first time. Difficult psychedelic experiences can be frightening, but also potentially among the most valuable experiences someone can have. What can you do to help someone having a difficult psychedelic experience? What techniques are available for helping transform a potentially traumatic situation into a positive or even therapeutic one? What role has the Zendo Project played at festivals, and what take-home messages are available for others interested in psychedelic harm reduction?",

As our group increased, so did our artisan base to include painters & sketch artists. We plan to have classes in making & decorating masks along with art classes in anatomy & anything inspiring to those attending.We will have live models to help with inspiration.We will have a plexiglas panel for instruction and colouring.\r\n\r\nArt classes will be held daily ranging from anatomy to landscapes, with live models or use of the plexiglas wall as a template.\r\n\r\nThe Plexiglas wall will be available at all times with markers to color on one side while the design is created on the other.A participant can take a picture of the creation to later print and add to their coloring book.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Artisan Menagerie is thrilled to provide the joy of creative expression mixed with various mediums from plexiglas to foam to paper.",

Connect with your true grounded self.\r\n\r\nI have practiced this meditation by myself for about 2 years. I am curious to see how this will work in a group setting as this would be a new experience for me. It is an open-eye meditation technique that focuses on the breath while also taking in your surroundings. The walking meditation focuses on the sensation your feet feel while walking at a slow place in a small circle. This practice helps form a connection with the earth as a sense of grounding. With practice, this technique helps one discover who they really are, not who they feel they are supposed to be. It has done wonders for me and truly changed my life. The instructions are very brief and basic and each person's experience is unique.",

Not in a judgmental way... This is meant in a good way. The very basic definition transphobia, is simply being frightened of trans-folks because of misunderstandings or lack of education on all things trans. This is often because the questions you\u2019ve always wanted to ask, are taboo; making it difficult to learn, understand, and honor the transgender path.\r\n\r\nTrans 101: The Nuts and Bolts.\r\nA brief PowerPoint discussion of definitions and the basics of gender, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation. How are transgender and cisgender people alike? How are they different?\r\n\r\nTrans 201: A Peak Through the Veil.\r\nAfter learning the basics, we\u2019ll have a Q&A session where any and all questions will be fielded. We all know that there are questions that are deemed inappropriate to ask a transperson. For this brief moment in time, there are no taboos. We will do our best to answer your questions with honesty, transparency, and sincerity.\r\n\r\nTrans 301: Dropping the Veil.\r\nWe will bare our souls and our bodies for visual inspection and further Q&A.\r\n\r\nTrans 401: Shredding the Veil.\r\nFor those brave audience members, we will open ourselves to not only visual review, but hands on, or hands in, examination.",

Since WWII the hosting and management of a refugee community in such camps has not changed. Till the day of today refugee camps are harsh survival environments where people risk exploitation, are hopeless and rules of the strongest apply. \r\n\r\nAfter being involved in the epicenter of the refugee crisis on the Greek island of Lesvos I came to the knowledge that there is such a big difference to be made in this global issue if we would stop seeing refugees, victims of injustice. Instead we should approach them as individuals with talents, opportunities equal to our own standards and with the same needs. We should be aware that if we would invest in people that have lost everything this investment will be returned to us in gratefulness and willingness to contribute in their own succes. You get what you give...\r\n\r\nIn creating communities that thrive you should start with environments that inspire. On Lesbos, the epicenter of the refugee crisis in Europe last year, I witnessed the similarities in dynamics between hosting refugees on a refugee camp and hosting a crowd on a music festival. We believe many insights from the festival industry can be integrated to redefine a refugee camp from a Spartan fashionlike environment to an inspiring festivallike experience.\r\n\r\nAdding to the festival game innovative solutions/companies, educational programs and integration of the refugee community in the management and self-sustainability of their camp will create an environment of harmony and dignity that will be an example in how to change a global issue into an opportunity that can serve humanity on a global scale. \r\n\r\nJoin me in this quest to redefine the global concept of a refugee camp to a campUS.",

We will use the intelligence of the movement to communicate. \r\n \r\n You can move being encouraged and guided by the intelligence of morphic fields (Rupert Sheldrake has published credible research about this). A morphic field is a field of energy that stores information; in the field exist dynamics, settings, games, processes; it is a memory field, it is an intelligent field. A morphic field is created when any of us introduces an intention and an action in space and time, which after being performed several times becomes a specific intelligence, then that intelligence influences the actions of a whole group and creates a memory of a way of doing things. We can create morphic fields at will, because our intelligence is able to. In a morphic field the communication is easy and instantaneous. What this workshop proposes is the creation of fields of intelligence through movement, because I believe that as human beings we are prepared to communicate with new languages. Art informs certain languages \u200b\u200bthat are developed over time, and perhaps now it's time to take those languages \u200b\u200bas structures that allow us a different way to function in life.\r\n \r\n Morphic Field Movement becomes physical expression, borne from body languages, from the poetry of the body, from the clear expression of the bodies...",

Thrill to see actual, illuminate images of people, places, and things (things!!!) that seem to move with a divine direction of their own making.\r\n\r\nLeonardo daVinci was himself taken with the possibilities of the Camera Obscura. Inspired, Liminal Labs Workshop does the Master one better by adding focused, intense illumination on a 53-foot white wall to offer an experience beyond what even Leonardo might imagine.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Movie Mirror Obscura dual screen system shines brighter than the heavens and is blended with sounds to tempt the dancing angels. From Tuesda through Friday, each evening\u2019s dark of night brings, not one, but two images magically mirrored, side-by-side for thy Royal amusement. Prithee shaketh thy booty if so moved.

Relieve stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds of friendship through group laughter. It\u2019s fun! The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. \u201cInappropriate\u201d Laughter Yoga is also a possibility, if our clientele are okay with it. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits.

This is an open discussion facilitated by Peter & Gretchen (aka Adam & Eve) about all things poly with children. This will be their 8th Burn, and the second with their 5 year old daughter, Veronica. Don't expect us to have all the answers, instead come to both learn and teach! Juice boxes and animal crackers provided to help grease the conversation.",

For the first time ever, Burning Man is hosting a series of workshops in a Florentine piazza-style format to have Masters of various craftsmanship skills teach our students the arts of the Renaissance. \r\n\r\nWe, The Three Faced (Stone) Wench Workshop/Guild, are offering a series of classes you would love to attend! \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the scoop:\r\n\r\nApprentices will learn the various actual old time techniques over several days to create a fresco (block) from scratch to take home. As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)\r\n\r\nUpon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not all! \r\n\r\nWe are offering a unique community project/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): \r\n\r\nWe are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt\u2019s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: \u201cAll You Need Is Love.\u201d The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nPlease join us! ;o)\r\n\r\nYouth ages 12 and up welcome.",

It is time for feminine power and leadership to rise and join a healthy, incorruptible masculine. Where are the positive archetypes of feminine power? Kali, who cuts off your head? Hera, who is the god form of holly homemaker: basically \u201cZeus\u2019 wife\u201d with a goddess-sized jealous streak? Wonder Woman, who battles evil but has no family and no love in her life? It\u2019s time for us to tell a new story of femininity, with our choices, with our self-expression, and with our lives. There are too few positive examples of women who are in full command of their sexuality and its attractive powers. There are too few healthy stories of women who\u2019s full creative expression is unbridled and uncontrolled. There are too few healthy stories of men who are powerful without creating harm and violence .  There are too few healthy stories of men who create win-win instead of win-lose.  Learn how to harness the feminine forms and masculine forms of power in each of your interactions and become a true manifestor - brining your highest vision into reality through your being, your words, and your actions.You will learn an unforgettable map of your own sources of power, some of which have been lying dormant for your entire life. Once you can locate and allow all four faces of incorruptible power to move through you, you can lead, inspire, and serve almost anyone. For Men and Women who want to bring their full spiritual presence into the material world and be the bridge between our present reality and the future vision only you can see.",

Five years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss.

Often, that energy is sexually directed. Combustion happens, but usually from the loins. This is part of our \u201canimal / darwinian\u201d nature. Nothing wrong with it per se \u2013 it is part of who we are. It is how the human race continues. \r\n \r\n And, we are more.\r\n \r\n This powerful energy can also be directed up and through the heart. And when it is, that force of energy has the power to soften the heart and break through walls we may have built up around it (fear, resentment, grudges, and other things that keep us from feeling our own Divinity). If the heart is open and cleansed, energy can move into that space. When it does, it creates a pleasure that makes sex seem rather mundane. The energy gets transmuted into spiritual power and ecstasy \u2013 Pure Love.\r\n \r\n In this workshop, we will use the power of yin and yang, platonic (non-sexual) touch and loving friendship to soften, expand and ignite the heart with Pure Love.\r\n \r\n Using the Light of our eyes and the Energy that moves through our hands and hearts we will connect with each other, swim in Love and glorify the Divinity within our hearts.\"",

As our group increased, so did our artisan base to include painters & sketch artists. We plan to have classes in making & decorating masks along with art classes in anatomy & anything inspiring to those attending.We will have live models to help with inspiration.We will have a plexiglas panel for instruction and colouring.\r\nMasks: There will be masks available to take for coloring with markers,crayons,pencils & decorating when the shop is open.\r\n\r\nAdult coloring books:There will be books available to take for coloring along with playa-friendly crayons.While the shop is open other items will be available for coloring.\r\n\r\nArt classes will be held daily ranging from anatomy to landscapes, with live models or use of the plexiglas wall as a template.\r\nThe Plexiglas wall will be available at all times with markers to color on one side while the design is created on the other.A participant can take a picture of the creation to later print and add to their coloring book.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday of the event,we plan a masquerade ball to show off the masks & visit other shops. \r\n\r\nWe will also have a metal stamp with a press to imprint on medallions or tin cans or the masks. We plan to have 2-3 different designs, one will represent the Reno Region.\r\n\r\nOur Artisan Menagerie is thrilled to provide the joy of creative expression mixed with various mediums from plexiglas to foam to paper.",

Five years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss. Lines are shortest early in the week, and early in the day.",

For the first time ever, Burning Man is hosting a series of workshops in a Florentine piazza-style format to have Masters of various craftsmanship skills teach our students the arts of the Renaissance. \r\n\r\nWe, The Three Faced (Stone) Wench Workshop/Guild, are offering a series of classes you would love to attend! \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the scoop:\r\n\r\nApprentices will learn the various actual old time techniques over several days to create a fresco (block) from scratch to take home. As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)\r\n\r\nUpon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not all! \r\n\r\nWe are offering a unique community project/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): \r\n\r\nWe are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt\u2019s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: \u201cAll You Need Is Love.\u201d The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nPlease join us! ;o)\r\n\r\nYouth ages 12 and up welcome.",

Five years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss. Lines are shortest early in the week, and early in the day.",

Each year, we shoot, develop and fix about one hundred photographs on the playa each Burning Man. he Pinhole Project exposes 30 x 40 inch sheets of light sensitive gelatin silver paper. We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa. The pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999.",

We will supply all water based acrylic paints in an array of colors. We will supply all brushes and artist knives. We will have palate mixing available as well as ample water and rags to assist you in color changes. We will maintain the entegraty of this project and make sure there is everything you need to get lost in your own world of art expression. We will have satellite radio for your listening pleasure and will keep the wall lit for several hours at night too! And the end of the event we will disassemble the wall and randomly distribute the finished canvases. These rare gifts will each hold the work of hundreds of passing artists who will have combined to create the memory of BRC 2016!!!\r\nAND...while you are there and if you dare, Thomas delFuego will let you choose a Rune from his pile of hand painted Runes. These stones on 10,000 year old sand concretions and will speak to your heart and that very moment:):):) Come join Thomas and Darma delFuego and become our friends for life!",

By arousing kundalini energy the practitioner can activate third eye so that the distortions may be witnessed as they are released.\r\n \r\n We are our own best healer.

Inside each temple are housed experiences that are the basis of how we comprehend ourselves.  The temple that we are is an adventure.  In that adventure we are swimming through contradictions, polarity, wonder, desires, embarrassments; our emotions, feelings, curiosities, wounds, traumas.\r\n\r\nIn the temple, what develops is the movement of the psyche. Maibel and Anthony serve as psychopomp guides through the temple with different exercises, taking participants on a trip that expands comprehension of their human complexity, our connection to each other, the need to explore the conversations that we never had. \r\n\u3000\r\n\u3000\r\n<< The Temple \u2014 Convertere >>\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll engage in play that explores the unsaid.

His mentors include Christina Berkley, Guy Sengstock, John Thompson, Sean Wilkinson, Sara Ness, Amy Silverman, Jordan Myska Allen, Gina Brezini, and Nicole Daedone.\r\n\r\nWe moderate a Facebook group called The Temple exploring the unknown, the unheard, the unsaid \u2014 and union.

A container where guilt, shame and fear around giving and receiving touch may be stripped away. Where we simply interact with consciousness and choice and that each honoring of another further honors ourselves.\r\n \r\n We will begin with a simple ceremony of seeing and being seen, so that we may drop into presence with one another. \r\n \r\n From there we will co-create our agreements and boundaries for the evening. Then we will engage in some guided massage, so that no one needs worry about skill or technique. We can all learn and explore together.\r\n \r\n Elemental massage is a beautiful way to welcome our bodies and explore differing kinds of activating and sensation touch.\r\n \r\n Know that you may choose to participate with a particular partner. All boundaries around partnership, touch and clothing will be honored. \r\n \r\n This is an evening of self-exploration, opening to our natural touch-positive nature in a way which is intended to open more pathways to self-love.\"",

Come share your favorite tips and techniques by words and demonstration, and ask questions that have been plaguing you.\r\n\r\n\t* Drool or dry? \r\n\t* What about the gag reflex?\r\n\t* How do you use hands and still go deep?\r\n\r\nAnd guys, you must have comments you'd like to pass on, other than simply \"Yes, please\"!\r\n\r\n\t* Hate teeth?  Want teeth?\r\n\t* What about deep throat?\r\n\r\nHere's your chance to make your requests - and pet peeves - heard!\r\n\r\nThis is a participatory event open to couples of any combination, so long as one of them has some phallic protuberance and the other is applying lips, tongue, and maybe even throat to it.

We maintain a full wet black and white photographic darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs. Photographs made of paper with traditional chemicals and no digital input. The Pinhole Project exposes 30 x 40 inch sheets of light sensitive gelatin silver paper. We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa. The pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999.",

Five years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss. Lines are shortest early in the week, and early in the day.",

These mirrors reflect you as you are, not reversed, and are truly magical!  \r\n\r\nTheres both science and an art here - your face \"works\" when you see it as it truly is.  In contrast it stops working, and you tend to stare at yourself in mirrors. Then get self-critical all too often. Even if you are feeling wonderful, like all so many times at Burning Man, a mirror doesn't reflect it naturally, so you tend to lose that sparkle and start to question your good feelings.  \r\n\r\nIn contrast, when you look in one of these true reflection mirrors, your face keeps working!  Your eyes, which have so much beautiful information in them, continue to have that same information that you can see.  This is what we see and read so well when we look at you.  That sparkle when you are happy, that depth when you are being deep, that vitality and genuineness that we know about you, now you can see it too!  So easy to believe in yourself when you see all that true energy you have. \r\n\r\nThe result?  Expect to be absolutely floored.  You are an amazing creature - a Human Being, and now you can see what that really looks, and feels like.  The feedback loop you find yourself in now is clear and complete, so smiles look like real smiles and you will smile back.  Complete with sparkle!!! Beautiful!\r\n\r\nThere's lots of posters in the Palace (which is made from giant tinker style toys) to explain it all.  If you don't see the magic, ask one of us for a demo and explanation. .. we want to get you to your own AHA moment!   \r\n\r\nNote-this is the same Palace that has been under the Man, on Playa, on Esplanade and in Center Camp!  Don't Miss It - Its Magic!",

For the first time ever, Burning Man is hosting a series of workshops in a Florentine piazza-style format to have Masters of various craftsmanship skills teach our students the arts of the Renaissance. \r\n\r\nWe, The Three Faced (Stone) Wench Workshop/Guild, are offering a series of classes you would love to attend! \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the scoop:\r\n\r\nApprentices will learn the various actual old time techniques over several days to create a fresco (block) from scratch to take home. As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)\r\n\r\nUpon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not all! \r\n\r\nWe are offering a unique community project/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): \r\n\r\nWe are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt\u2019s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: \u201cAll You Need Is Love.\u201d The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nPlease join us! ;o)\r\n\r\nYouth ages 12 and up welcome.",

Pinhole Project has brought to the playa twelve very large pinhole cameras created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. Join us in our annual pilgrimage to use old school pinhole photography on the playa.\r\n\r\nThe Pinhole Project exposes 30 x 40 inch sheets of light sensitive gelatin silver paper. We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa. The pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999.",

Though gentle, relaxing, non-impactful movement sequences along with inspirational meditation, you will leave the day standing straighter and taller and with your shoulders falling back behind your chest, hence allowing you to lead with your heart as you walk forward into the world.\r\n \r\n Think of Feldenkrais as meditation with movement! \r\n \r\n If you are experiencing any pain, you might find it improve or resolve throughout the class. Feldenkrais helps with the realignment of our bones, muscles and joints and with the coordination of our overall movement patterns.\r\n \r\n As we radiate more love out into the world, the world can\u2019t help but smile back. And with that, only magical shifts can follow.",

Will death be the end of life? The pain experienced in the lead-up to death or the manner death is portrayed may have lasting impressions on how we determine our own death. If death is a passage and a natural step, like a leaf that falls and disintegrates into the earth, how do we best prepare to be ready, at a moments notice to fall onto earth, without a shred of remorse, guilt or unpacked potential? This workshop is about giving yourself a chance to look deeper into death with a clean slate. Determine your own method to prepare for death and live life with an openness to dying. The heart-opening exercises are done alone, and with the group using resonance tuning, energy-centering and creative visualisation. Raise your consciousness!  with Tia Kansara",

We supply you with the stone, paint and guidance; you supply your awareness, vision, and imagination. Together on your planetary journeys, after 4.5 billion years you and the river stone meet. Silly or profound, the colors or imagery are all a part of the play on the Playa. Will your rock become a bug, a power object, a flower, or a psychedelic paisley? Experienced art teachers can help with color mixing, brush technique, and concept execution. Create a memory to keep or offer as a gift. Thurs: 3-5PM.",

Utilizing the core tools of Tantra: Breath, Sound, Movement and Touch we are slowing down, and we are being together just as we are. As we slow down and link up breath and sound we create all these exquisite feedback loops- body to body, belly to belly, heart to heart, and we invite each other into more and more presence, trust and relaxation.\r\n\r\nEmbodied Intimacy guides everyone gently from a state of separation and isolation towards safety and oxytocin fueled connection. The result is a simple felt presence, real time intimacy and heartfelt shared truth. The story and drama of the mind subsides and a new level of being is found in its place. In-To-Me-I-See. Sound by Sound, sigh by sigh, breath by breath it all unfolds, melts and unwinds. At the speed of love we learn how to live from the wisdom of our heart instead of the worry of our minds.\r\n\"",

Come learn how fear and our essential state of being work in a dynamic relationship to create our EGO (impulsive actions, and self-defeating beliefs and habits). In this workshop, we will touch on the basic understanding of fear and it's differentiation from Worry, Anxiety, and False Fear. Then dive deep into existentialism explaining why fear has such a programmable hold on our free will, and biology, causing our impulsive actions and thoughts. Then we will explore techniques I've used to transcend my own fears, self-defeating beliefs and habits, freeing myself from years of insecurity, blame, resentment, childhood abuse, guilt from molestation, and general self-hate. I will share every method that has worked for me, and then afterword we will have a Q&A, and have a fun conversation and share our experiences. \r\n\r\nAbout Me: Hello my name is Nine Johnson, I'm a Performance Anxiety coach in Los Angeles California. I usually work with Actors, Singers, Athletes, Directors and businesses people from all industries to identify and overcome their performance anxieties, insuring confidence and peak performance. I come from a spiritual and self development background with over 15 years experience, in counseling, and life coaching.",

In cognitive psychology FOMO is known as loss aversion.  Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. Most studies suggest that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains.  Basically FOMO is the losing out on what others are currently experiencing and valuing it higher than the gain of your current experience.  An early example of FOMO comes from Tulipmania in Holland in the 1590s.  Seeing and hearing others buy into the promises of tulip profitability encouraged others to do the same. Nobody wanted to be the one missing out. \r\n\r\nWhen you lose something it hurts and often to avoid this negative emotion strange behavior may occur. This talk will give insight into why FOMO occurs and illustrate that it happens not only to Millennials anxious about what experiences their peers are having, but also to those making business and investment decisions.",

(Like \"gifting,\" eh?) He was freed, moved to Southern California, and taught classes of students and future teachers. Today, weekly classes abound in So Cal, around the US, and the world.

Most of us seem to have evolved over the last million years to be polyamorous by nature. But we are socialized into monogamist mating norms that amplify sexual jealousy, reduce compersion, stifle our sexual sovereignty, and limit the social networks that we instinctively try to build through lovers and metamours. In this talk, a leading evolutionary psychology professor (author of 'The Mating Mind', 'Spent', and 'Mate') will give a quick, fun overview of the new science behind poly. Then we'll have a Q&A.",

Visitors are encouraged to interact with each other, to cooperate, and to let their imaginations roam, molding polka dot trees, green cows, castles, dinosaurs, and UFOs.  Make a blue fish, your friend can make a red bird, the next person will make a small man, together we'll have the beginnings of a whole new world, with the reflections of the infinity box making it look like there's whole schools and flocks of strange creatures and a crowd of people, all interacting.\r\n\r\nYou get to be the Mad Sorcerer, create whole worlds in your crystal ball, just to mess with them.  You get to say how creative and lovely your pet world will be.  There's no skill required, no creation too boring or too creative.  A red, and yellow and purple castle?  Yes!  A small brown snake?  Yes!  Every play-doh creature has a place with us.\r\n\r\nWant to see how the project is going?  Want to Contribute and Volunteer? Like us at https://www.facebook.com/Mad-Sorcerer-1698581610391522/ for project updates and event announcements. \r\n\r\nOpen 24-7, for kids of all ages, shade, play-doh and infinity box worlds provided.",

We encourage beginners, intermediates and those curious about BDSM play to come, learn, and experience in a safe, non-pressured, and supervised environment. As our name implies (Playfully Yours), we focus on the lighter, softer, and more sensual side of BDSM. Our personnel are available to provide instructions and demonstrations on the safe use of the equipment and will supervise play or can help facilitate play.  We\u2019ll also have an outdoor dungeon play area equipped with a double St Andrews Cross, spanking bench, and stock. We also have a lounge area where you can relax and meet our campmates if you are over 21 years old with id. The lounge has a spanking bike, a corn hole bean bag game, lounge chairs, a mini bar serving cherry bombs, and a spinning wheel to facilitate participation. In Mist\u2019R Cool\u2019s Camp you can have the Cool Mist Experience with a fully automated misting booth, try to put together oversized 3D and 2D puzzles, show off with a 10\u2019 dance pole, and experience the Cool Massage with a new and advanced sensual massager. Come for a private intimate portrait session in Bare Naked Tramps Portrait Studio. Individuals, couples, and groups are all welcome. Relax and enjoy great company in the exquisitely decorated Marshmallow Lounge. There will be libations for your pleasure and theme nights get dressed up for such a James Bond 007 party.

For the first time ever, Burning Man is hosting a series of workshops in a Florentine piazza-style format to have Masters of various craftsmanship skills teach our students the arts of the Renaissance. \r\n\r\nWe, The Three Faced (Stone) Wench Workshop/Guild, are offering a series of classes you would love to attend! \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the scoop:\r\n\r\nApprentices will learn the various actual old time techniques over several days to create a fresco (block) from scratch to take home. As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)\r\n\r\nUpon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not all! \r\n\r\nWe are offering a unique community project/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): \r\n\r\nWe are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt\u2019s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: \u201cAll You Need Is Love.\u201d The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nPlease join us! ;o)\r\n\r\nYouth ages 12 and up welcome.",

We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Nude is not lewd so uninvited or inappropriate touching is prohibited.

We will teach you simple traditional hand working metal skills to cut, shape, and hammer aluminum into a sexy bikini bra and/or bottom. Decorate with bits of jewelry to personalize yours. Tie with leather thong for a secure fit.  \r\nThese are the same metal shaping skills that craftspersons used in Da Vinci\u2019s time to create beautiful works of art. Wear and share yours here at Burning Man! Allow about 2 hours for completion. Come early- limited supplies. Feel free to bring any small or broken baubles, earrings, etc.  to donate or help decorate bikinis with. \r\n\r\nYour partner can come watch, but this is primarily  a workshop  to empower women to learn to use simple hand tools to release their inner creativity. Costumes like this cost $$$ when purchased.  Make it as sexy as you dare. Yours is free to keep, and you'll be proud to wear it! Since each piece is custom formed for you, it will fit perfectly- large or small. And yes, it is cool, light and comfortable- even on the playa.\r\n\r\n(As an added bonus, \"Sunny\" our resident body painter will also be on hand to offer body decoration if anyone who wants to wear even less!)",

Many of us have engaged in sensual touch with a lover or tickling at a young age, but are you aware of how well the two can work together to make an amazing sensory experience with someone? Whether it is tickling to tears, to moans of delight, or simply squirming Kelli Lynn Sage (Domme Sage) is well versed in this and will be leading this class in sensual touch and the art of tickling with a partner. Domme Sage has learned the ropes over the years and wants to pass her wisdom on to you. She will instruct you, with the help of her assistants and volunteers, on the art of tickling and sensual touch. This event is for those 18 years old and over (please bring your ID if you look young). We may be requesting volunteers from the audience for some aspects of the class, so if you are eager to be part of this hands on experience let us know. People of all gender identities are welcome to attend. It is best if you can come with a partner so you can practice some of what you learn, if you come alone we cannot guarantee to partner you up with someone. We recommend bringing a towel or something similar to lay on the ground to sit on. In addition we ask that you be respectful of all participants and remind you to ask before touching someone that you have not made arrangements before hand.",

The results of the jury cannot be protested. All performances are scored on a scale from 4.0 to 6.0 \u2013 6.0 being the highest possible. Scores are given to one decimal point (e.g. 5.4, not 5.48). A single score is given to each air guitarist based on their overall performance in that round.\r\n\r\nThe score reflects the quality of the performance based on three key criteria:\r\n\r\n1.\tTechnical merit - You don\u2019t have to know what notes you\u2019re playing, but the more your invisible fretwork corresponds to the music that\u2019s playing, the better the performance.\r\n2.\tStage presence - Anyone can do it in the privacy of their bedroom. Few have what it takes to rock a crowd of hundreds or even thousands \u2013 all without an instrument.\r\n3.\t\u201cAirness\u201d - The last criteria is the most difficult to define yet often the most decisive of all. Airness is defined as the extent to which a performance transcends the imitation of a real guitar and becomes an art form in and of itself.\r\n\r\nPlease note: the scores from BOTH ROUNDS are added to determine the contestants\u2019 final scores. This combined score determines the winner.  Earn the title of Black Rock City Air Guitar Champion!",

You can also ignite passion, dissolve shame, manage PTSD, or dive into even more elaborate erotic exploration.  It is possible to shape shift, time travel, change your age or status, safely feel fire, and even go against the laws of physics. Are you Captain F*cking America, a pink purring sexy kitten, or galavanting in Medieval times wielding your sword while riding a Pegasus? Yes! Anything is possible here!\r\nThrough Hypnosis we can travel far out into imaginary places, safely remove emotional blockages, as well as shift negative patterns and limiting beliefs that prevent our clients from having the intimate lives that they crave.\r\n*Learn how and why Hypnosis is so effective in exploring kink, sensation play and more\r\n*Learn history & practical uses for Hypnosis\r\n*Learn how the mind sabotages the best goals and desires \r\n*Get a small taste of what Hypnosis is like and let\u2019s meet come face to face with your inner most juicy and alive sensual self! \"",

Multiple host camps will have bartenders standing by with icy libations prepared exclusively for the riders. Among this year\u2019s host camps are Barbie Death Camp & Wine Bistro, Duckpond, Cubhouse, BAAAHS, and Celestial Bodies. The ride culminates with an 80s Jazzercise Dayglo afterparty hosted by the wonderful folks at Comfort & Joy. If you\u2019re willing to meet the dress code, join us for one of the goofiest parties on the playa. No statement or political agenda; just riding our bikes, drinking some cocktails, and making new friends. Oh yeah, and we\u2019re naked. Mugs for the first 500 riders (and yeah, we always run out).

There is no wrong way to do this.\r\n \r\n Open the door to your body to express the unimaginable. \r\n \r\n In the experience, you will be guided through a passage in which you find your own way of moving the body. I don\u2019t ask anyone to move their body in a rhythm, nor engage bodies, nor expect that all the people do the same action. People don\u2019t need to follow a pattern or imitate; it\u2019s experiential, there is no wrong way to do this. I give directions based on trust in the body, and what it can manifest. The person will discover how to adapt these directions to their understanding and needs. Maybe someone can move rapidly, maybe another can move slowly, or hardly at all \u2014 each one with their own development and course of action.\r\n \r\n This workshop focuses on the method of \u201cThe Unknown Theater\u201d (El Teatro Desconocido) directed by Juan Carlos De Petre and developed over forty years by a group of people concentrated on exploration of subtle expression. The practice reveals knowledge; we start from the consciousness of not-knowing \u2014 ignorance is the beginning. This knowledge is experimental and creative; not intellectual, preconceived, acquired through repetition, or memory. Participants will work as a unique being, independent, and according to their own development. You can overcome intimidation and shame; discover empowerment, physical malleability, and grace.",

Love transforms all.\r\n\r\n'The Divine Masculine and Feminine Healing Circle' is an event where the men of the playa are invited to step into their higher selves, and consciously hold the energy of the Divine Masculine. Josie Posie leads a ceremony where the women of the playa welcome the men lovingly at the entrance to the dome, inviting them to match the high vibration they hold. The dome becomes an Ancient temple space. The men then stand in a circle offering unconditional love and healing to the community of women who gather in the center. The women come for healing their trust of the Masculine and to receive their love. This is a hands-off workshop. There is no touching except optional hugging at the end. \r\n\r\nWhen men show up and become the pure presence of their Divine Masculine nature and truly witness them, then women can relax into their loving Divine Feminine nature and fully become that love. As both polarities do this, we transmute cultural wounds in the collective feminine and masculine for all of humanity, co-creating a needed and beautiful new balance.",

Five years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss. Lines are shortest early in the week, and early in the day.",

Our Signature drinks are Vodka Lemonade (no promises on ice)  White trash Mimosas, Tang Bang, and we serve ice cold draft beer, we hardly stop there... Our Bartenders are on Vacay too so they can be nice or they can be snarky! Sometimes drinks are gifted, sometimes they are bartered; but never sold!!! So leave your $$ in your camp, and bring something fun to tip your bartender!!! Please bring a cup that you can pimp out while you wait. We do not operate on any schedule, so the rule of thumb is: If the barstools are down, we are most likely serving drinks, or at least attitude... Some of our games include: Pool, fooseball, tether ball, shuffleboard, white trash horseshoes, and we are excited to introduce nascar inspired drag racing!",

Appreciating my life means waking up every morning and looking into the mirror, and saying to myself, 'I am so happy to be alive!' Thank you Osho, for helping me to create this meditation.\" I designed this meditation so that it can be done in a group or by yourself. The first six stages are an oppertunity to practice dying consciously, a rehearsal for the end of your life. The remaining four stages are a reminder to live totally and cherish each moment.",

Jimmy and the Guild are masters of turning parts from the Golden Age of American manufacturing into beautiful assemblages.\r\nAudience artist participants thru the week who experience the ADA's booth can put in their name for a lottery to be drawn at 6:30 on Thursdays evening, to be one on 10 chosen artists for this special event. The 10 artists will get a blank board to work on, will choose their own subject matter for the art, and show it to Jimmy at the start of the build. Imagine speed chess!!! where Jimmy will take their suggestion, lay out a few pieces to start and instruct the artist to apply what he did, and as Jimmy works around to the other artists, they add their own vision until Jimmy comes back around, to compound the vision! All other Guild members will help with instruction, tools, and raw materials in this frantic 2 hour filmed creation of 10 unique works of art, finishing with flair and fire into the darkness! As with all created art during the week, the artists rule what happens when done... keep, showcase, give away, burn, gift it...",

Five years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss. Lines are shortest early in the week, and early in the day.",

This year, in name of \"Radical Self Expression\" we sent out five hundred vinyl toy elephants to kids all over the world and asked them to express themselves by decorating them.  We are then taking those elephants and displaying them at Burning Man under The Man as part of the Guild Workshops piazza.\r\nOur aim is to bring awareness of the importance of creativity in a child's life. Lack of funding has stopped art programs in many public schools across the country. We are figuratively and literally putting the crayon back in the child's hand. We are also bringing 10,000 elephants to the playa this year and letting burners express themselves by decorating the elephants, and gifting them to fellow burners. \r\nWe chose to create a vinyl elephant for the kids to decorate because of the elephant's outstanding memory. We are building positive experiences in children that we want them to remember for a lifetime. \r\nWe also sculpted the elephant into the shape of the Vitruvian Man, as a wink to this year's Burning Man theme.",

As we dance, we will awaken the elemental spirits within our physical bodies as we invite that sacred tremor which frees our hearts to love to move us so that we may release that which has held us back and shed any limiting beliefs so that we may invite new gifts and possibilities into the empty space within. By embodying this ritual, we attune our body to tend toward our highest good while making space to step with clarity into what is next. Then we will offer the healing practice of Medicine Dance to melt some of the walls to giving and receiving that love within. From that place, we will dance in the cultivated energy of the tribe - a full wave to ground all the gifts, shake loose any layers ready to release and make even more space to be empowered to our birth right to love and be loved, starting with the Self.",

To make this new rule a temporary or permanent part of the participants life, he or she can print this rule on pieces of old German files, badges, wristbands or even body parts.",

Through this sacred ceremony we can realize of the true nature of the Self and experience into the state of total oneness.\r\n \r\n This Tantra Puja is a way of honoring and adoring the divine that dwells within each of us. \r\n \r\n What is a Heart Opening Puja? Watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osqSdVTIZ_4\r\n \r\n This is a \"station\" puja. There is an inner and outer circle. One rotates and with each rotation you have a new partner. Each partnering is an opportunity to fall in love with ourselves through the eyes of another.\r\n \r\n The stations are subtle, elegantly simple and this is their potency. The tantric arts invite us into our own heart in an ease full way. One of the most exquisite is this ceremony where we open to an embodied experience of witnessing the divine in all and thus the diving in ourselves.\r\n \r\n Open to the possibility of adoration, forgiveness, unconditional love and experiencing your true and higher self in the span of a few short hours.",

Well come on down to Recycle Camp and SHOW US YOUR CANS!!!  At Recycle Camp we want all of your ALUMINUM cans as part of our gift to the playa. We are located at 6 and Center Circle behind the Center Camp Cafe and will be open every day until 5pm. No drop offs allowed, when you get there you will help us quickly separate your cans before riding the Crushinator, our magical bicycle-powered can crushing apparatus, to compact the cans so we can store as many as possible before scrapping the aluminum off-site. All of the money we generate from can recycling is donated to the Gerlach school system. We only accept aluminum cans so please keep all of your soup or heavy metal cans. If you are unsure if it is aluminum a good rule of thumb is if you can't crush it, then we don't want it. Also, some stout beers like Guinness also have a plastic widget that cannot be recycled with the aluminum, please remove of be conscious of it before bringing them to us. PROTIP from the Recyclenauts: bring a MESH bag to store all of your cans in. Plastic bags won't allow your cans to dry out, so please store them in a mesh bag before bringing them over to Recycle Camp and help make things a little less juicy for us when we crush them. Be smart, plan ahead, Recycle Camp wants YOU to come CRUSH it with us!!! We are CLOSED ON MONDAY, plan ahead!",

This will bring us to feel the vibrations and the energy of the universe. The intensity of the technique depends on the person, ranging from an incredible feeling of ecstasy, until space and time journeys. Being a technique that connects with the inner and higher self, it will also allows to experience breakthroughs, get answers about our lives, solve problems that we didn't even know to have. The more open to receive love and the more open minded we will be, the more we will get from this practice. The technique is as powerful as magical. Almost everybody that have experienced it, described it as mind blowing, many as life changing, some others as the most powerful moment of their life.\r\nPrepare to experience yourself in Totality!",

Afterwards we will scatter to share the spirit & purpose of this year's temple.\r\n\r\nIn perihelion to this event, some of us winged folk will gather again for a night-time circling of the temple, at midnight after the temple burn, around the ashes of the Temple.\r\n\r\nNote: The Temple Guardians enthusiastically anticipate this participation, and only ask that we be prepared for them to begin the soft-close of the temple around dawn on Sunday, followed by the firm closure by 8 AM. Parking bikes >500' away from the Temple is requested if you want to stay in the area past 8 AM.\r\n\r\nhttps://walkofthewings.wordpress.com/home",

        "desc": "Contact Improvisation is a meditative dance technique in which participants use points of physical contact to provide the starting point for exploration through movement. This contact can actually induce the production of a pair bonding hormone, called oxytocin, in the human brain, similar to how you feel when you hug or kiss a loved one. \r\n\r\nThrough the sensation of touch and dance, you can explore organic movement generated through and with, one-another, forming new bonds and strengthening old ones.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by a variety of musicians, this session will begin with some simple guiding prompts to help individuals become familiar with touching as well as giving/receiving weight. As the jam progresses individuals get to explore movement by listening and responding to their partner/partners through touch. There are no right or wrong answers and you do not need prior dance training to participate. \r\n\r\nThe central characteristic of Contact Improvisation is a focus on bodily awareness and physical reflexes rather than consciously controlled movements.  Much like meditation, Contact Improvisational Dance seeks to honor the present moment by guiding the dancers to surrender what is happening now. \r\n\r\n\u201cOne learns to recognize and differentiate subtle impulses in our movement choices and our partner's choices. We begin to decipher the cues that we give and receive which tell us when to lead or follow, when to go up, when to go down, where to touch, how to lift, when to slow down, and when to be still. In this form one learns to stay in integrity with each choice, never forcing, never rushing. When Body, Mind, and Spirit are united in their instinctive wisdom one finds ones-self at home in every moment expressing ones true nature.\u201d     \r\n\r\n- Moti Zemelman",

We as humans are microcosms of this universe, whatever exists in the outer universe also exists within. Feel the vibrations of this tangible Earth we live in knowing that everything is in motion and nothing rests. Tantra is a system so intuitive and natural to human kind that its essence can be seen within all spiritual paths from the Celtic, African, Native American, Sufi, esoteric Christian, Hindu, Sound Healing, Kabbalah, Buddhist, and Taoist wisdom traditions. It is a set of spiritual practices and ritualistic actions that through personal effort and experimentation are designed to direct universal energies of the macrocosm into the practitioner to achieve total liberation from ignorance and suffering. In this workshop we will use a myriad of psycho-physical exercises learned from different traditions for modifying and exploring consciousness. We will feel the energy of the Earth and learn to appreciate this vibratory field we exist in. with Ashleigh Rojas",

Our camp wants to see each individual spirit, to hear each story and to offer moments of real connection. We plan to offer: \r\n\u25cf\t60 seconds or more of Intentional Gazing. \r\n\u25cf\tFive Minutes or more of Focused Listening. \r\n\u25cf\tGenerous Hugs - just as long as each visitor wants. \r\nfrom 1 to 5 PM, Mon through Fri. (or pretty much any time we\u2019re in our big round public living room). We want to empower and encourage our campers and visitors to continually offer these same three tokens of human contact through out BlackRock City and on our travels all over the world. \r\nWe will have paints and card stock so anyone who wants one has a chance to paint their own sign to offer hugs, gazing and listening. \r\nWe'll have other spontaneous events so check our sign! Relax with us! Have some Water!",

Stories told by others give us insight into how they think and feel.  When we hear something in a story that we connect with we don\u2019t feel so alone in our own thoughts. Truth is, we are much more likely to remember something if we hear it in a story then just the facts. Humans are social beings and enjoy others for the most part and listing to stories gives us that connection.  But what actually makes up a story?

Five years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss. Lines are shortest early in the week, and early in the day.",

We will cover stalls, lasso\u2019s and body breaks. Lastly, we will integrate everything we\u2019ve learned into a magical wand dance where you will captivate others with your ability to magically float a levi wand! This will be a short string workshop. Wands will be provided. Welcome to all ages",

Through singing we can develop deep contact with ourselves, it opens the heart and silence the mind. It connects us with each other and is a way of being present in the now. \r\n \r\n About Fia:\r\n Fia Forsstr\u00f6m is a singer-/songwriter from Sweden who creates music with a wish to move something inside of you. Lyrics that reflects all of life; here is the beautiful and wild, but also the ugly and uncomfortable. She is driven by evoking thoughts and to inspire. She has a great passion for the healing power of singing and creating spaces where people can meet each other just as they are. After experiencing the enormous joy and energy of chanting circles, singing together without any focus on achievement and instead let the song come from the heart, she wants to open up and invite more people to share that magic.\r\n \r\n https://www.facebook.com/FiasMusic/",
